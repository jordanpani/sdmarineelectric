						Our amazing adventure to Peru and Ecuador began last March when we were so fortunate to come across your website. The entire process with you and your company has been most enjoyable and little did we know that we were going to be in such professional and accommodating hands. 
 
From the moment we landed in Lima we were looked after every step along the way, we were treated so well by everyone representing Stanford. Your guides and staff were exceptional, we must mention that Marco who guided us during our day in the Sacred Valley and during our city tour of Cusco was outstanding. He is very knowledgable, very accommodating, very funny and became a good friend.  The hotels in Peru were truly magnificent and the staff at each and every one of them made us feel at home. We are grateful for your selection of hotels for us. First Class! The people of Peru in every sense of the word, were incredible. So warm and friendly and we must have heard a hundred times, &quot;Thank you for visiting my country.&quot;

						Our trip was wonderful and far exceeded our expectations. All transfers were smooth and accommodations were perfect. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. It was very hard to return home, but 
our over 7000 photos (digital fortunately) will help keep the memories fresh. I can't even pick a best thing because each day was filled with so many. 
Thank you for all your help planning this trip. I would be more than happy to serve as a reference for anyone interested in a similar trip.

						Just wanted to send you a quick note to thank you for all the arrangements you made for our Peru and Easter Island trip! All the hotels and guides we had were absolutely fantastic. The Aranwa hotel in the Sacred Valley was particularly special, and the lunch at Casa de Orihuela was lovely. Our guide, Dagmar, in Cusco was excellent, and we feel as if we got to know a bit about how people in Cusco live today, as well as those from long ago. 

The Amazon was great, and Reserva Amazonica was first class. The food was terrific here, and in all of our hotels - which isn't often the case with hotel food. I was particularly impressed with how good the food was at Hotel Altiplanico on Easter Island, considering that so much is brought in from abroad. Even the Holiday Inn Express at the Santiago Airport had good food. 

We still can't believe all the flights, trains, and rendezvous with the guides were on time and went off without a hitch. I can't say that about most two-day business trips, let alone a two-week adventure!

Thanks so much for arranging such an awesome trip!

						We met you while enjoying a superb luncheon with our guide at Casa Hacienda Orihuela on 31 May.  When we spoke, we told you how impressed we were with the customer service of every person with whom we came in contact in our time at Hotel Monasterio.  We also told you we would return for another night there prior to leaving Peru, and that I had asked for the same room (#409) as we loved it, and would be celebrating our 41st wedding anniversary. 
 
We returned to the hotel, our luggage we had left there was already in our (#409) room, and as we began to re-do our bags for our trip to Ecuador, there was a knock at the door and a celebratory bottle of champagne from you with a note.  This is a perfect example of why your hotel is as amazing as it is.  We have many examples.  For instance, I believe I told you about Claudio at the bar who recommended we try té de muna, not just maté de coca.  He made us a pot of tea, and even brought us the herbs so we could see what they were.  
 
We sat that evening at a romantic table for two and the two Claudia's served us.  Dinner was delicious.  
 
Beyond this, your hotel was perfect for us as I have loved chant and Baroque music since the 60's.  Walking into the hotel and climbing the stairs to the music was like realizing that someone knew exactly what we love.
 
I told you my brother and his family will come to your hotel in December when they take the same trip from which we have just last night returned.
 
Thank you for so many wonderful moments and memories,
