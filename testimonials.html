                      cruise, meeting wonderful, interesting people from all
                      over the world. There were 15 different countries represented
                      on our boat. The snorkeling is great. We saw, from the
                      sundeck, a huge black manta ray, the gigantic kind. Many
                      saw it while snorkeling. We saw, tons of wildlife, including
                      a pod of sharks in 2' water. The islands are better than
                      you can imagine. The food on board is VERY good &amp; the
                      service is excellent. I would send my own (adult) kids
                      on this cruise without hesitation. The crew is terrific,
                      the islands beautiful... I would have no reservations going
                      on this boat for a 2nd cruise. You will love it &amp; have
                      a great trip!&quot;</td>

                      me, it becomes absolutely priceless to be met by a smiling,
                      English-speaking guide to help us maneuver through the

                      the Galapagos Island cruise. It was absolutely fantastic!
                      The cruise was great, the crew professional, and the islands
                      unbelievable. My only regret was that I could not stay
                      on board longer. Thank you for putting the flights together
                      and making all the necessary arrangements onboard the ship.
                      All the transfers worked out well, and everything went
                      smoothly. I highly recommend you to anyone who is interested

I just wanted to tell you how happy all of us were with the arrangements made by both of you on our recent trip to Ecuador.  The trip could not have been better and there is not one thing I would change..I would recommend both of you to anyone that is considering taking this trip.<br>
It really was a trip of a lifetime and all of the people and tour guides that we had were just great..we enjoyed every second of the trip.  I just cannot believe we were there and back..it now seems just like a dream.<br>
If you ever want to use me as a reference, I would be glad to sing your praises....thanks again for everything and I hope that we can use your services again when we go back to South America.</td>

                      Douglas - We're at the airport in Quito, waiting for our flight to Lima, and I thought I would send you  an interim report. Everything so far has been wonderful!&nbsp; The Galapagos  cruise could not have been better. The Eclipse is a great ship, and the crew  and guides were uniformly great. And the EQtouring people have taken very good  care of us. Fabriccio took us on an excellent tour of Quito before the cruise, and he took us  to Otavalo today. That was a very interesting and enjoyable&nbsp; excursion,  and we were really glad that we had decided to add it at the last minute. We'll  give you a full report (and a few photos) when we get home. Thanks for all your  help in putting the trip together. Doug and Marcia
<p>We're  loving Peru, too - and the arrangements here  have also worked like clockwork. We had a great guide (Roger Valencia) in Cuzco and the Sacred Valley. We're enjoying our second day at  Sol y Luna today (a beautiful spot!), and we're leaving for Machu Picchu bright &amp; early tomorrow.  We'll email some photos when we get home. </p>
