  U.S. citizens must carry a valid passport to travel in South America. In general,
    the passport must be valid for up to six months from the time of entry. NO visa is required for U.S. citizens to enter Ecuador or Peru. Currently,
    U.S. citizens <strong>must</strong> have a visa to enter Brazil. Please check with the Brazilian
    Consulate for the most recent requirements. See www.Brasilemb.org It is a
  good idea to carry along a photocopy of your passport's front page and an extra
    passport photo in case your travel documents are lost or stolen. <br>

Some countries may require you to have a yellow fever inoculation if you have
  been traveling in South America recently, or in the last ninety days. Other
  inoculations may apply depending on your age and where you are traveling. It
  is best to consult with a medical travel specialist for the latest requirements.

It is advisable to make and carry copies of your most important travel documents,
including your passport and airline tickets. Also, keep copies of your credit
card numbers and the contact numbers for your credit card companies in a separate
place, not in your wallet or purse. If lost or stolen, having a copy of these
documents will be invaluable. In addition, keep in mind that many countries in
Central and South America, including Costa Rica, Brazil, and Ecuador to name
a few, require that you carry proof of citizenship on you at all times. Therefore,
keep a photocopy of the photo page of your passport and a form of legal identification
with you when on the mainland, while in the city, or anywhere where you may be
required to make purchases. Keep in mind, that you may be asked to show your
passport when making large purchases or when changing travelers checks.</td>

Keep in mind that neither we nor anyone making your trip arrangements is a medical authority. You should consult with your physician, local health officials or the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, GA. Much of the information below comes directly off the CDC website. The CDC offers an excellent section for travelers. You can access the site at http://www.cdc.qov/travel/. For travel to Ecuador and Peru access the region known as Tropical South America or go directly to http://www.cdc.qov/travel/tropsam.htm. The CDC also has a dial up number  where you can request a fax by following a series of prompts. </td>

When making international airline reservations always use your name exactly as it appears on your passport. Using a nickname or another surname that does not match your passport can cause major hassles. Always make sure the name on your passport and air tickets match. Name changes are also extremely difficult to make with the airlines, so it is your interest to get everything correct at the start. </td>

                  The Galapagos Islands and Machu Picchu in Peru, are  a year round destination that offers a great winter getaway on the equator. If you are traveling from a northern city in the winter, remember that snow storms can come in (to your home airport) and cause flight delays. We therefore highly recommend that you add at least one extra day onto the front of your trip if you are flying during the winter months in the northern hemisphere. </td>

                <td height="191" class="content">ALTITUDE <br>
                  Because Quito (and also Cusco in Peru) are in the Andes above 9,000 feet, some passengers traveling from lower elevations may experience the symptoms of altitude sickness. This condition manifests as a  shortness of breath, headaches, or nausea.  In many cases these symptoms will begin to lessen and pass with time, as the body adjusts to the altitude. Therefore, it is advisable to plan to take it easy for the first day or two. Resting is helpful as are over-the-counter analgesics. Please consult with a travel physician. Maintaining hydration, by drinking lots of water or beverages, also seems to diminish symptoms for some. It is recommendable, that passengers eat lightly for the day before traveling and avoid eating heavy food after  first arrivng in Quito, or Cusco. Passengers who want to travel to the Galapagos Islands and wish to avoid the altitude in Quito can make quick and easy connections for hotels and flights in Guayaquil, which is on the coast of Ecuador. Passengers who wish to travel to Machu Picchu and avoid the altitude in Cusco, can transfer directly to the Sacred Valley -as Cusco is above 11,000 feet above sea level, and the Sacred valley is 9,000 feet above sea level. </td>

                  As with any large city, one is advised to take precautions to insure safety and security. Police patrol tourist areas regularly. Even so, you should remain alert to your surroundings and maintain a good grip on your camera and pack if you bring them along. Leave your passport, most of your cash and all but the credit card you plan to use in your hotel lockbox. Carry a copy of your passport with you for identification. When making large purchases at local stores, you may be asked to show your passport. These are normal precautions for any city you are unfamiliar with. You will find Quito or Lima, or Cusco to be a beautiful, friendly and enjoyable place. Your guide will answer any other questions you have regarding security.<br>
                  Most Galapagos cruise ships now provide security lock boxes/safesin every cabin on all  vessels. In addition, each vessel may have a larger lock box under the care of the Captain. Please be sure to leave your valuables in the personal lock box in your cabin or in the one under the Captain's care Jor the voyage. This includes passport, cash, jewelry, cameras, cellular phones, etc. You simply do not need these things (except your camera) in the Galapagos on all but  rare occasions.</td>

Most airlines allow only two check-in pieces and one carry-on item not exceeding
  a specified dimension and weight. Check with your airline. Additional weight
  restrictions will apply if you are traveling to the Galapagos Islands or to
  the Ecuadorian Amazon. Currently the weight limit for those traveling to the
  Galapagos Islands or the Amazon regions is 44 pounds. In countries such as
  Costa Rica, we have seen weight restrictions as low as 25 pounds per person
  on internal flights or charter flights to such areas as the Osa Peninsula or
  Tortugeru.  Check with
