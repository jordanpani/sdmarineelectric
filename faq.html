                                                from a northern city in the
                                                winter, remember that snow
                                                storms can come in (to your
                                                home airport) and cause flight

                                                Because Quito (and also Cusco

                                                9,000 feet, some passengers
                                                traveling from lower elevations
                                                may experience the symptoms of
                                                altitude sickness. This
                                                condition manifests as a
                                                shortness of breath, headaches,
                                                or nausea. In many cases these

                                                and pass with time, as the body
                                                adjusts to the altitude.
                                                Therefore, it is advisable to
                                                plan to take it easy for the
                                                first day or two. Resting is
                                                helpful as are over-the-counter

                                                a travel physician. Maintaining

                                                water or beverages, also seems
                                                to diminish symptoms for some.
                                                It is recommendable, that
                                                passengers eat lightly for the
